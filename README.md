# ATM-Bank-Simulation-Cpp
C++ Software Development School Group-Project

The aim of this project was to make a realistic demo version of Automatic Teller Machine, ATM for short, where cash can be withdrawn, balance can be checked and account transactions can be browsed. 

The primary objective was to make an application like a traditional ATM. The secondary objective for the project was to add an advertisement window to the application. This feature shows an advertisement to the customer, when the cash is being withdrawn. The lenght of the video depends on the amount of the withdraw.

Qt Creator was used in this project and the application was programmed by using the C++ language. Olimex branded RFID-reader for the authentication. Cards were used to be able to identificate the person using the application. MySQL was used on creating and controlling the database. Every member of the project group (4) made a component of their own for the project (DLL or EXE). The components were integrated in the end to form a working application.
